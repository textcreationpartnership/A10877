            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2439:6"/>perfect we ſhall be, the greater ſhall our loue be to Almighty God: the holy Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is full of this doctrine, as alſo the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of <hi>S Paul,</hi> and the liues of Saints. <hi>Hoc eſt maximum &amp; primum ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datum &amp;c.</hi>

<note place="margin">Hier ep. ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metriad lib. de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micit.</note> &amp; eadem nolle ea demum firma amicitia eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Hierom</hi> borrowing the ſentence from an other Philoſopher: ſo that the more one is conformable and vnited with the will of God, the better and more perfect he ſhall be, it being moreouer moſt certaine, that the will of God, is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and perfect thing, which may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, and ſo by conſequence he is better and more perfect, who comes the neereſt to the will of God. And it was the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an other Philoſopher; if God be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2439:7"/>the moſt exquiſit and perfect thing of all, the nearer on comes for to reſemble him, the more exquiſit and perfect he ſhall be.</p>
               <p>The ſecond foundation is; that there can chaunce and happen nothing in the world, but by the will and ordinance of God, ſinne o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly excepted, of which God is neither Author, nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſibly be. For as cold is naturally oppoſit to heat, warmth to water, and darkeneſſe to the ſunne, ſo much and infinitly more, is it repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the eternall goodnes of Almighty God, to haue any friendſhip or commerce with wickednes,
<note place="margin">Abacu. 2.3.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Abacuc</hi> teſtifies: <hi>Mundiſunt oculi tui, nevideas malum, &amp; reſpicere ad iniquitatem non poteris,</hi> thy eyes are pure that thou maiſt not ſee ſinne, &amp; thou maiſt not looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniquity.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.</note> that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſight of it. <hi>Quoniam non Deus volens iniquitatem tu es.</hi> Seeing thou art not a God (ſaith Dauid) who haſt any

                  <hi>dilexiſti iuſtitiam &amp; odiſti iniquitatem,</hi> thou haſt loued iuſtice &amp; hated iniquity. In briefe the holy ſcripture doth euery where abound, with teſtimonies of Gods mighty hatred and deteſtation of ſinne; and therfore he can no waies be Author of it. But excepting ſinne I ſay, all other things, all miſeries and all calamities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on vs for our puniſhments, proceed from the ordination and the will of God: which foundation is moſt infallible; there being no ſuch thing as chaunce or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in the world, as the Heathens er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roniouſly did faine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither are thoſe goods, which the idle world abuſiuely cal goods of Fortune the donatiues of any ſuch thing, as Fortun, or of chaunce; ſince there is no ſuch thing as they are ſaid to be, but they are gifts beſtowed by the hand of God; As the Holy Ghoſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, by the wiſeman, <hi>bona &amp; mala,

               <p>And although theſe things are often by other ſecondary cauſes brought to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2439:8"/>paſſe; notwithſtanding it is moſt certaine, that there happens nothing in this great Republique of the world, without order from this ſouueraigne Emperour who hath all dominion in it, there is nothing by chaunce or accidence to God, but all which happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to vs, firſt paſſeth through his hands, and his diſpoſure of it.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2439:8"/>vpon Matthias but not by chaunce, it being the pleaſure of God by that means, to elect him for his Apoſtle; This verity, the better and more morall Philoſophers, haue by the only helpe of naturall light found out, and ſo they ſay, that diuers things, in reſpect of their ſecondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are fortuit and caſuall, wheras if you regard their primitiue cauſe, they are no waies caſuall, but done with mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and deſigne: which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by the example of one ſending a ſeruant vpon ſome occaſion to a certaine place, and diſpatching another vnto the ſame place, by an other way; now they meeting both together there, &amp; one not knowing of the others se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding do ſtraight imagine that they are met by chaunce, whereas vnto him who ſent them it is no caſuall thing, but done with purpoſe &amp; deliberation. In like manner although oftentimes ſom things for as much as men can perceaue fal out as it were by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, becauſe they are vnexpected vnto them, neuertheles vnto God Almighty they are no waies ſo, he hauing ſo ordained them, for ends ſecret and hidden to the eyes of men, and only knowne vnto his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2439:9"/>That which we are to gather from theſe two foundations, which we haue laid, is the concluſion of what we haue propoſed: which is, that ſeeing all thinges which happen to vs, are procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the hand of God; and that all perfection conſiſts in the conforming of our ſelues vnto his will; we are therfore to roceaue all thinges as coming from his hand, and conforme our ſelues in them, vnto his diuine and holy will, we are not to eſteeme any accident to come by chaunce, or that any man hath had his hand in it; for this only ſerues to vexe and diſquiet vs: neither are we to thinke that this or that is happened vnto vs, by any one procurement, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would not haue chaunced, for ſuch and ſuch reaſons as may occure vnto vs. But letting paſſe all ſuch imaginations, we are to receaue all things, as being ſent vs from the hand of God, by what way ſoeuer they arriue vnto vs. For it is he who doth direct them ſo.

Of the firſt God is the Author; and of the ſecond man. Let vs put the caſe; on entring into quarell with an other kille him: vnto the killing of him, there is required, that he lay hand to his ſword, that he lift it vp, that he let fall his arme, and giue the blow; with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other naturall motions, which may be a part conſidered by themſelues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſorder and commotion of that mans will, by whoſe interuention that other man is kild: and of all theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by themſelues and conſidered apart, God is the Author, and produceth them as he doth all other effects in creatures deuoid of reaſon; ſeing that as nothing of it ſelfe, without the helpe of God can put it ſelfe in acte, or motion; ſo alſo (without him) this man could not haue
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2439:11"/>ſtired his arme, nor handled his ſword, and more ouer theſe naturall actes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are not bad, ſeeing that if a man ſhould make vſe of them in his defence, in a lawfull warre, or as executioner of Iuſtice, and ſo kill an other, he ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit no ſinne; but of that fault, which is in the diſorder of the will, by which this wicked wretch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mits that outrage, and of the diſaray of reaſon, God is not the cauſe, how euer he permit it, in that he could haue hindered it, and yet out of his iuſt iudgments, doth not. They vſe to declare this by a compariſon, a man hath a wound in his foot, and by reaſon therof he haults, the cauſe why he doth go vpon his foot, is the vertue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue power of the ſoule, but the occaſion of his lamenes in his wound, and not the vertue of his ſoule: ſo likewiſe, in thoſe actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by which men come to ſinne, God is the cauſe of the action; but the defect and ſinne, proceeds meerly from the mans free will.</p>
               <p>So that although God neither is nor can be the Author of any ſinne, yet we are aſſuredly to hold, that all the euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on vs for puniſhment of our ſins,

                  <hi>SAint Baſil</hi> ſays that the height of all the ſanctity and perfection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, conſiſts in attributing the cauſes of all things to God, how little or great ſo euer in themſelues they be, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues in them vnto his holy will. But to the end that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comprehend the importance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof, and be incited by our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards it, to ſeeke and procure it with greater diligence; we will more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2439:14"/>declare the great good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, which is contained in this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the will of God. The firſt is that intire and perfect reſignation, which the Saints and all Maſters of ſpirituall life do extoll ſo much, pronouncing it the root and ofſpring of all our tranquility and peace, as being that whereby a man is wholly ſubmitted and reſigned into the hands of God, as a peece of clay into the Potters hands, to be faſhioned and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as he pleaſes, without deſiring to haue any intereſt longer in himſelfe, neither to liue, to eate, to ſleepe, or labour for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but wholly and intirely for Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God: and this is effected by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, ſeeing that man thereby reſignes himſelfe wholly vnto the will of God in ſuch manner, as not to deſire any thing; but only that the diuine will may be moſt perfectly accompliſhed in him; as well in point of what he is to do, as in all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which may happen to him, aſwell in proſperity and conſolation, as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and aduerſity. Which is a thing ſo gratefull and pleaſing to Almighty God, as for this only reaſon, he ſtiled <hi>Dauid</hi> a man according to his owne harte. <hi>Inueni

                  </gap> God, my hart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Secondly he who hath this intire and perfect conformity with the will of God, muſt with all haue attained to an intire and perfect mortification, of all his paſſions, and vitious inclinations; We are not ignorant how highly neceſſary this mortification is, how much it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and extolled in the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and by the B. Saints. Now this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is a meanes which of neceſſity muſt precede the attaining of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the will of God, this being the end, and mortification the meanes to arriue vnto it; and we know the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of any thing, is vſually more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2439:15"/>and perfect then the meanes. That mortification is a neceſſary meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto this vnion, and intire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conformity with the will of God, we may vnderſtand by this, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which lets and hinders this vnion and conformity, but only our proper wil, and diſordinate appetits, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the more they ſhall be mortified and ouercome, the more deare and ſtrait wilt this vnion be, and this conformity with the wil of God. For to ioyne a rough hewen planch, and make it ly euen with an other which is wel ſmoothed and plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we muſt firſt paſſe it ouer with the plainer and make it euen; and ſo in like manner mortification goes perfecting &amp; poliſhing vs, vntill it make vs fit to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God, and applied in all things to his holy will, and therefore the farther we ſhall proceed in mortifying our ſelues, the nigher we ſhall come to vnite &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne our ſelues vnto the will of God, and when we ſhall once come to be perfectly mortified, we ſhal then haue attained vnto this perfect vnion and conformity.</p>
               <p>From hence proceeds an other good and profit, which we may reckon for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2439:16"/>third; and that is, that this reſignation and enrire conformity with the will of God, is on of the greateſt, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifices, which any man of him ſelfe can offer to Almighty God. For as much as in other ſacrifices, he offers only his goods; but in this, himſelfe is offred vp: in other ſacrifices and mortifications, he only mortifies himſelfe in part, in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, modeſty, ſilence or patience, he offers but a part and portion of himſelfe; but in this a perfect holocauſt, whereby he offers himſelfe entirely and altogether to his Diuine Maieſtie to be diſpoſed of, in all things as he pleaſeth, and when, and how he pleaſeth, without any exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or any reſeruation to himſelfe; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is as much difference betwixt this ſacrifice, and all other ſacrifices and mortifications, as betwixt a man, and thoſe goods which belong vnto him, or the whole of any thing, and any part thereof.</p>

               <p>The fourth is, that whoſoeuer ſhall haue brought himſelfe to this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, will be poſſeſſed with the perfect charity and loue of God; and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progreſſe he makes in it, the greater and dearer will be his loue of God, and conſequently his perfection, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this perfect loue and charity, and

<note place="margin">Doroth. doctrina 9.</note> or rather declares this in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner: he ſays, that he who in euery thing conformes himſelfe vnto the will of God, in ſuch manner, as to make all his owne inclinations readily ſerue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is come vnto ſuch a paſſe as to doe his owne will in euery thing, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a perpetuall gladnes and quietnes of mind. To declare that which we would procure to ſay, we will giue an example of this in point of obedience, and make but one labour in diſpatch of two affaires. We ſay commonly to thoſe who deſire to enter into Religion, and to make their liues iourny by the way of obedience; you muſt make account when you are entred into Religion, neuer more to doe your
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2439:30"/>owne will againe: and <hi>S. Dorotheus</hi> ſays on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary neuer feare it you may do your owne will, &amp; that not only lawfully but alſo holily, &amp; with much perfection.

And ſo in conformity to this, I ſleepe as much as I will, becauſe I deſire not to ſleepe longer then obedience appoints; I cate as much as I deſire, ſeeing I require no more, then that which is allotted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; I pray, I read, I labour as much as I pleaſe, and take vpon me as much pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as I thinke is neceſſary for me, ſince I do all theſe, and in like manner all the reſt, according to the preſcript and will of holy obedience. And in this manner a good Religious man, without hauing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2439:31"/>any inclination of his owne, comes to do his owne will continually. And this is it which makes thoſe Religious, who are good indeed, appeare ſo cheerfull &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſpoſed; for that which re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders them alwaies content and glad, is the making the will of obedience their owne.</p>
               <p>In this point of obedience conſiſts all the facility, and difficulty of Religious life, and on this depends the ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a Religious man. If you put but on a reſolution, to renounce your owne will, and receaue the will of your Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in the place of it, the Religion will be eaſy and ſweet vnto you, and you will liue in it with much content and ioy; but if you nouriſh a will contrary to the will of your Superiour, there is no liuing in Religion for you. two different wills in one perſon are incompatible; We ſee by experience although our will be but one, yet when our ſenſuall appetit is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vnto reaſon and to it, how little aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and how little reſt we haue; and yet this appetit is but an inferiour &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to our will: but what ſhall we thinke when two equall wils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

This we may eaſily apprehend from the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which we experience in our ſelues, when we are in tentation, and when we are free from it: for when we are without tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all things ſeeme light and eaſy to vs; but when we are aſſaulted with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or ſubiected to any griefe or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, that which was wont for to be eaſy to vs, is ſtraight conuerted into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and we thinke we ſhall neuer be able to go through it, but that heauen &amp; earth are come together againe, all as it were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiring to bring vs difficulty.

Behold here a generall anſwere, to giue ſatisfaction vnto all ſuch demaunds, and in its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality it imploys no difficulty, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more eaſy and familiar. For if it be the will of God, it is beſt and moſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2439:38"/>conuenient for me, I may with all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, caſt my ſelfe, in vttering that which hath been ſaid, into the armes of God Almighties will and hereby the diuell wil be fruſtrated of his purpoſes, and depart aſhamed, and we ſhall become ioyfull and couragious with the victory. And as in tentations againſt our faith they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile (eſpecially thoſe who are ſcrupulous) to anſwere nothing in particular, but in generall to ſay; I beleeue and hold all which our holy Mother the Church beleeues and holds; ſo alſo in this tentation whereof we ſpeake, the beſt remedy is to giue no anſwere in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but to haue recourſe vnto the will of God, which is both good and perfect in a moſt high degree.</p>

The firſt is when a man doth neither accept of, nor deſire thoſe things which go aceompanied with paine, but rather ſhuns them, yet ſo as he had rather vndergoe them, then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſinne to be deliuered from them; this is the loweſt degree and of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſo much as although a man in his miſhaps be ſenſible of paine griefe and diſcontent, although he ſigh and grone whilſt he is ſicke, and cries out through the vehemency of his griefe and bewailes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2439:66"/>the loſſe and death of friends, yet with all theſe he may ſtill haue conformity with the will of God. The ſecond degree is when a man (although he doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that any harme ſhould chaunce vnto him, neither makes choice of it) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding when it is once hapned to him, doth willingly imbrace and ſuffer it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the good pleaſure and will of God: and this ſecond degree, ſurpaſſeth the firſt, in that a man in ſome ſort hath a liking and affection to ſuffer diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity and paine for the loue of God, and proceeds ſo farre, as to deſire it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Gods pleaſure it ſhould be ſo. The firſt degree ſupports theſe things with patience, the ſecond implies beſides, the ſuffering them promptly and with willingnes; The third is when the ſeruant of Almighty God, out of the great loue he beares our B. Lord, doth not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, and ſuffer moſt willingly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer paine and affliction which he ſhall ſend him, but alſo is longing for them, and reioyceth in them becauſe he knows them to be the will of God.

And our B.

But thoſe of the Society, ſaith he, ought in no wiſe to intermedle themſelues, or procure to beſent, and abide more in one place then an other, but they are to remaine wholly indifferent, leauing the free and intire diſpoſition of themſelues in the hands of their Superiors, who gouerne them in the place of God, as may be moſt for his ſeruice and greater glory.</p>
               <p>And that we might perceaue what an abſolute indifferency and readines to go vnto any country of the world, where holy obedience might diſpoſe of vs, our B. Father requires;
<note place="margin">Lib. 5. c. 4 vitae P. N. Ignat.</note> we read in his life, that F. Iames Laynes once ſaid vnto him that he felt a great deſire in himſelfe, to go vnto the Indies to procure the ſaluation of thoſe blind Infidels, who were loſt for

Father anſwered that for his part he had no ſuch deſire, and being ask't the reaſon, he ſaid, becauſe that we in hauing made a vow of obedience to his Holines, to go vnto any part of the world where he ſhall ſend vs for the ſeruice of Almighty God, ought to be intirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and not to haue any inclination more to on place then to an other; and he added more ouer if I did perceaue my ſelfe as you inclined, to go vnto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, now, I ſhould beſtow all my indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, to bend my inclination to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that ſo I might arriue to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect indifferency and equality, which is required to the obteining the perfection of obedience.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding we doe not ſay that the deſires which we may haue of going to the Indies, be either ill, or imperfect, for they are ſo farre from that, as they are both good and holy, and as ſuch, it is good to propoſe and preſent them to our Superiors whenſoeuer our Lord ſhall pleaſe for to inſpire them, and ſo our B.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2439:70"/>comforted when ſuch deſires are propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto them, by any of their charge, ſeeing that they are moſt commonly the ſignes, that ſuch are called vnto it by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and ſo they come to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of with greater ſweetnes and more gentlenes: but we haue ſaid it vnto the end that we might perceiue the readines and indifferency which our B. Father requires of vs, to go and remaine in what part of the world ſo euer; ſeeing that he would not ſo much as haue vs affected more then ordinary vnto a miſſion ſo labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſo much importing the ſeruice of Almighty God, as that; and that vnto the end that our inclination to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing, might not ſet any barre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt vs and that promptitude and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency which we ought to haue to any other thing, or place, beſides vnto which Obedience might thinke fit to ſend vs.</p>
               <p>From hence there may be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences drawne forth, which may helpe vs better to comprehend this ſame. The firſt is, that if the deſire of going for the Indies, ſhould be occaſion to him who doth conceiue it, of failing in any point of this redines and indifferency vnto any
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2439:70"/>other thing, which obedience might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him, that then it is not good, but an imperfection: if I were taken with ſo great deſire, and weare ſo ſet vpon going to the Indies or els where, that it ſhould diſquiet me, and be the occaſion that I ſhould remaine with leſſe contentment either heere or in any other place where obedience ſhould diſpoſe of me, and that I did not diſcharge with that willingnes thoſe preſent functions in which I were imployed, neither performed them with due application, by reaſon my eyes and thoughts were fix't vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that other thing; then it is moſt apparant, that ſuch deſires are neither good, nor proceeding from God Almighty, ſince they are impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto his will, and God cannot be contrary to himſelfe: as alſo becauſe the deſires and inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the holy Ghoſt, do not vſe to go accompanied with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquietnes but with a profound peace and tranquility. And this is one of the ſignes which the maſters of ſpirituall life do giue, to know whether our inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and deſires be proceeding from God or no.</p>
               <p>Secondly it followes from hence that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2439:71"/>he who ſhould haue an vniuerſall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, both prompt and indifferent to tranſport himſelfe into any part of the world, or to performe any thing which obedience ſhould preſcribe, although he felt in himſelfe no ſuch particular incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as others haue of going to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any other country remote or neer, hath no reaſon to trouble himſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that he is no waies in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſtate, but rather the better diſpoſed, it being ſuch a diſpoſition as our B. Father requires of all the Society, to haue of our parts no affection or particular deſire, more vnto one thing then an other; but he would haue vs in a diſpoſition anſwerable to the tongue, of a ballance which inclines no more to on ſide then an other; and of this ſort are many, or according to my opinion the greater part. Our B. Father had taken a deliberation once to ſend F.

There is no doubt, but this mans diſpoſition were better and more perfect, and ſuch as theſe the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors neuer doubt, to diſpoſe of, either to the Indies, or any other place.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the principalleſt point of all, our B.

                  </gap>ckly all their liues. So that for as much as concernes our miſſion to the Indies, or among the Hereticks, each one, as we haue ſaid, may freely propoſe his inclination and deſire, ſo as it be with indifferency and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but in this point of health, there is not permitted any liberty, either to aske our remouall or to ſhew our ſelues incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therunto, which is much more then the other; only it is permitted, that if any one finde himſelfe ſick or ill diſpoſed, he may propoſe to the Superior, his ſickneſſe and indiſpoſition, with his diſability to diſcharge his functions, and thus much we are obliged to do by Rule; but hauing once propoſed it, we are to do nothing more, it belonging only to the Superior to aduiſe, if ſuppoſing he be ſo ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it were not fitter to ſend him to ſome other place, where by recouering his health he might be enabled to do more; or whether it were not to Gods greater glory, that he ſhould ſtill remaine in the ſame place, although he performed not ſo much or perhaps nothing at all, for this concernes him nothing. Euery one is to ſuffer himſelfe to be guided by his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2439:73"/>who in the place of God hath the diſpoſing of him, and to eſteeme what ſo euer he ſhall ordaine, to be the beſt, and moſt confering to the ſeruice of Almighty God. How many are there who only to get their liuing do liue here and in other places which are moſt contrary to their health? how many are there who paſſe the ſeas to the Indies and Turky for a litle gaine, and put not only their health but alſo their liues in daunger? What great matter is it then if we (who are Religious) do ſo much for God, and for obedience, as thoſe of the world do, to gather wealth together? And if it ſhould occurre vnto your mind, that you could do ſomewhat in an other place, or perhaps very much, and that there where you are your health is impairing, and your labours nothing, do but remember that for all this, it is better for you to remaine there in doing nothing ſince it is the will of God, then to haue your owne will in being remoued to any other place, although you ſhould doe neuer ſo much; and conforming your ſelfe with the will of God, who for the preſent requires ſo much of you, for cauſes which he knows beſt, and which it is not

               <p>In the Chronicles of the Order of S. Francis we read how S. Francis gaue leaue to Brother Giles, to go where he would, and to liue in whatſoeuer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince or Couent he pleaſed, leauing him to his owne free election as being one whom he knew of great vertue and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, but the holy man, had not liued fower dayes in this manner &amp; freedome, but he found the tranquility and peace of his ſoule ſenſibly diminiſhed, and in lieu thereof a great liſquietnes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation in his mind; whereupon he went to S.

               <p>S. Hierome relates an example very fitly ſeruing for this preſent ſubiect, he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2439:77"/>ſayes that viſiting thoſe holy Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks who liued in the deſert, he ſaw one whom the Superior had commaunded (both for his owne aduancement in perfection, as alſo to giue an example of obedience vnto the younger ſort of Religious) to carry twice a day, a mighty ſtone three miles, vnto no other end, and for no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but to obey and mortify his proper iudgment, and this had he already done for eight whole yeares together. This ſaith S. Hierom would appeare vnto thoſe who do not know the true value of the vertue of obedience, and haue not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto this purity and ſimplicity, but are yet of proud and hauty minds, but a childiſh thing, or an idle action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they would demaund of him, how he could indure to be ſo imployed by obedience, and euen I my ſelfe (ſaith this Saint) did queſtion him and deſire to know what motions he felt within his heart, whilſt he was performing this; and the bleſſed man anſwered him, I am as content and glad when I haue executed this, as if I had done the moſt high and important thing as they could haue commaunded me: and S. Hierom ſayes that this anſwere did ſo

This is to be a Religious man indeed, and to lead an anſwerable life vnto their ſtate, not to regard what the exterior action is, but to make the will of God our pleaſure &amp; delight, which we performe in doing of that acte: and ſuch as they, are thoſe who profit and go ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly forwards in vertue and perfection, ſo as euen to make it their liues ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to do the will of God, wherewith they are nouriſhed as with the very fatnes of the corne. <hi>Et <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We read an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of this kind in the Chronicles of the Order of S. Dominicke, &amp; it is of Albertus Magnus, who was the Maſter of S.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2439:83"/>helped by a certaine viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for as he ſlept one night, he imagined that he had reared a Ladder againſt the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery walls, and was going out and leauing the order, when climing vp he ſaw fowre venerable Matrons ſtanding on the top, of whom one ſeemed to be miſtriſe of the reſt, and when he was come cloſſe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, one of thoſe Matrons ſhou'd him backe againe and would not permit him to go out of the Monaſtery; notwithſtanding he aduentred once againe, and being euen at the top, the ſecond ſerued him as the firſt had done, and when the third time, he aſſayed to get vp againe, a third of thoſe Matrons demaunded of him, why he had ſuch deſire to leaue the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, vnto whom he anſwered, with a face al bluſhing with ſhame, becauſe Lady I ſee my companions of the ſame courſe with me, to profit in the ſtudy of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy whilſt I ſpend my time and labour all in vaine, which ſhame grieues me ſo much as it makes me reſolue to leaue my Religion, vnto whom the Matron ſaid, pointing him vnto the fourth of them, behould this is the Mother of God, and Queene of heauen, vpon whom we
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2439:83"/>with reuerence do attend, comend your ſelfe to her, and we with our intreaties will ſecond you, that ſhe would intercede vnto her B. Sonne for you, vnto the end that he would beſtow vpon you, a witt ſo docile as might render you fit to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in your ſtudies; which Albertus hearing was wondrous glad, and being conducted vnto our B. Lady by this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, ſhe receaued him gratiouſly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what he deſired and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for with ſo much earneſtnes? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſome degree of excellency in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which was the ſtudy to which he then attended, although he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended nothing of it. Whereupon the Glorious Virgin anſwered, be of good cheere and courage, and ſtudy well, and I will aſſure you, you will become an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and learned man in the ſcience of Philoſophy, but to the end that you may know, ſaid ſhee, that it is a donatiue only of my fauour, and not attained by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parts, or induſtry of your owne, ſome time before you dy, you ſhall come to forget whilſt you are in your publique lecture, all the learning which you had before. With this viſion was he greatly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2439:84"/>comforted, and from that time he profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo greatly in his ſtudies, not only in Philoſophy but alſo in Diuinity &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the holy Scriptures, as nothing can better witneſſe then thoſe works which he hath left behind: &amp; three yeares before his death, as he was actually tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching at Collen, he wholly loſt all memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of euery thing which belonged to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, remaining as ignorant, as if he had neuer in his life ſo much as knowne the firſt rudiments of any Science; &amp; it may be alſo that it is ſo befalne him, in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his want of indifferency, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the will of God, in point, of that tallent and ſufficiency which he had beſtowed vpon him. Howeuer, he then remembring the viſion which he had at that time when he was minded to haue forſaken his Religion, did publikely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his Auditors declare what had paſſed, and therupon taking his leaue of all, he retired himſelfe to his couent and there ſpent the reſidue of his time in prayer and contemplation.</p>
               <p>Now that we our ſelues may not fall into this danger, it is neceſſary that we go preparing our ſelues before; and there is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2439:84"/>no better preparatiue then a deepe humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for ſuch a difficulty as this proceedeth only from the want of it, when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure to be accounted the worſt and laſt of all your courſe. If one ſhould come afterwards and let you vnderſtand, that you were to ſtudy no more, and that you were to breake of your courſe, and all thoſe proiects which you had fancied to your ſelfe; and in the meane time you ſhould ſee your Companions go on with their Diuinity, and become learned and famous preachers: here now without doubt were need of profound humility, and a great reſignation to the will of God. And this tentation comes to be renewed againe after your ſtudies are done, when you will not want ſuch thoughts as theſe to be working vpon you againe: why am not I ſo learned, and in as high place as he? why am not I an excellent Preacher? why haue not I ſuch a grace in ſetting my ſelf forth, and in diſcourſing as this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath? wherfore am not I imployed in important buſineſſes, and why do they make ſo little account of me? and the like is to be ſaid of thoſe who are not ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, for you ſhall haue them buſied with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2439:85"/>ſuch thoughts and tentations as theſe. Oh that I were a ſcholler? that I were a Prieſt and had but learning to be profitably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the helpe of ſoules, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may fall out that ſuch a tentation as this may bring you to ſuch ſtraits as to in danger the loſſe of your vocation, and perhaps your saluation too, as the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table falls of others do teſtify.</p>
               <p>This is a generall doctrine, and euery on may apply it to his owne ſtate of life, and therfore it is neceſſary for euery one to conforme himſelfe vnto the will of God in being content with that Tallent which he hath receaued from God, and that ſtate of life which he hath placed him in, without deſiring to be more, then what God Almighty hath ordeined him for to be.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2439:105"/>when they haue not been well prouided for; Now Religious men haue long ſince freed themſelues of all theſe things, and therfore they cannot be grieued nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When a tooth is well cleared and ſeparated from the gummes, you may plucke it eaſely out, but if you go about to draw it out, without firſt looſing it from the fleſh, it will coſt you exceſſiue paine; In like manner a Religious man, who is ſeuered from his friends of fleſh &amp; blood, and free from all worldly things, is not agrieued at the article of death to leaue them all, ſince he had freely and with merit before giuen ouer all part in them, at his firſt entrance into Religion; not expecting to depart with them at the hower of death, as worldlings do, who then muſt leaue them whither they will or no, neuer without great ſorrow and griefe; and oftentimes without all merit: they rather leauing their poſſeſſors, then they who did poſſeſſe them, leauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But death is no whit bitter to a Religious man, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquitted himſelfe of all, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the contrary pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as being an end and concluſion of all his paines and labours, and as a paſſage only to receaue the premium and reward for all that which here he left and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for God Almighties ſake.</p>
               <p>An other principall thing, which vſeth in this article of time, exceedingly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict worldly people,
<note place="margin">Ambro. de bono mortis c. 8.</note> and render death terrible and fearfull to them, is, ſaith S, Ambroſe, an ill aſſured conſcience and want of diſpoſition, which hath, or ought to haue no place in a Religious man, ſeing that his whole life is nothing els then a continuall preparation vnto death;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2439:106"/>It is recounted of a holy Religious man that when the Phiſition aduiſed him to prepare himſelfe for death, he anſwered, euer ſince I haue taken the Religious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, my whole exerciſe hath been nothing els; an exerciſe befitting euery Religious man.

And this is the difference betwixt the good, who are ſignified by the ſheepe, and the bad and carnall men, repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by thoſe other beaſts. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner who is condemned to dy, is ſtroke to the heart, at euery opening of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dore, as fearing the officers are then
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2439:107"/>comming to take him from the priſon to execu-ion, but he who is innocent, and expects to be acquitted by the Iudge, is glad euery time he heares the turning of the key, as hoping that they come to ſet him at liberty. In like manner the wicked when he heares the noiſe and ſtirring of the bolt of death, when ſickneſſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, when his fits redouble, is in great dread and feare, ſeing he hath a cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed conſcience, which makes him ſtand in dread that euery thing is meſſenger of death, and comes to carry him downe to the eternall fire of hell; But he who is not pricked with theſe ſtings of conſcience, receaueth comfort from it, as knowing his liberty to be intended by it, and that he is to depart vnto eternall reſt, and to a pleaſure that neuer ſhall haue an end. Let vs do then as becomes good Religious, and we ſhall not only find no difficulty in conforming our ſelues vnto the will of God, concerning the hower of death, but alſo reioyce in it, and beſeech God with the Prophet, to deliuer vs from this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

But ſome one ſhall aſke me, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all theſe things there may be ſo much of our owne will, and immoderate loue vnto our ſelues as may need mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration euen in point of them. I anſwere yes, and that from hence the malice of ſelfe loue may be perceaued the better, ſince euen with things ſo good and holy as theſe, it forbeares not to mingle the poiſon of its infection. Spirituall ioy and conſolation is very good, becauſe by helpe of them, the ſoule doth eaſely ridd it ſelfe, and come to deteſt all feeling and delight in worldly things, which is the bait and nutriment of vices, and takes heart and breath, to go on cheerfully, in the ſeruice of God, according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Pſal 118.31.</note> 
                  <hi>viam mandatorum tuorum cucurricum dilataſti cor meum,</hi> I haue runne in the way of thy coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements then when thou haſt dilated my heart, the heart dilateth and extends it ſelfe, with ſpirituall ioy and conſolation, and on the contrary, becomes narrow and ſtraight, with ſadnes and deſolation. The ſame Prophet likewiſe ſayes, that when God ſent him conſolations, they were as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2439:133"/>wings vnto him, which made him runne and fly in the wayes of vertue and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God; Spirituall conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do moreouer helpe very much, to the breaking of our owne will, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercoming our ſenſuall appetites, to the mortifying of the fleſh, and to beare our croſſe and all aduerſities which may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue with greater conſtancy; And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God vſually doth firſt ſend theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ioyes and conſolations vnto thoſe, whom he intends afterwards to viſit with afflictions &amp; deſolation, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare &amp; diſpoſe them by the one, to make their good and profit of the other.</p>
               <p>As we ſee, our Sauiour would comfort his diſciples with his glorious transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on the mountaine, that they might afterwards be leſſe troubled and deiected to ſee him ſuffer and dy vpon the croſſe. We ſee likewiſe that God moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beſtows his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolations vpon new beginners, that they may throughly forſake the delights of the world for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly comforts, and afterwards when he hath ſurely obliged them vnto him in the bonds of loue, and he ſeeth them well rooted and confirmed in vertue, then he
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2439:134"/>exerciſeth them with aridity, that they may the better attaine the vertues of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and humility, and merit a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant increaſe of grace and glory, by ſeruing God purely, without the helpe of conſolation. This is the cauſe why ſome in the begining when they are newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or perhaps before their entrance, when they haue but conceiued the deſire, do feele greater conſolation &amp; ſpirituall delight, then euer after, for God then deals with them accordig to their age, giuing them the milke of Infants, to traine them out of the world, and bring all temporall things into contempt and hatred with them, but afterwards when they are well growne and fit for harder meats, he giues them ſuch food as doth become their yeares. For theſe and other the like ends, God ordinarily doth ſend his conſolations and ſpirituall guſts. And therfore the Saints commonly do coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell vs, in time of conſolation, to prouide againſt the comming tentations; like as in time of peace, they vſe to make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for warre: for the day of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is commonly no other, then the Eue and vigill of tentation.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:2439:134"/>
               <p>Spirituall comforts are therfore very good and profitable, if we know how to vſe them, as we ought to do, wherfore when ſoeuer God beſtows them on vs, we are to receaue them, with humble thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, but if any one ſhould wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon them, and deſire them only for his owne contentment, becauſe of the guſt and delectation which the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth in them, it were imperfection in him, and diſordinate loue vnto himſelfe. For as in things neceſſary to ſuſtaine our life, as eating, drinking, ſleeping and the like, if a man ſhould make the pleaſure of them his end, it were a defect in him, ſo if one ſhould pretend no other end in prayer, but theſe ſenſible feelings &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, it were a ſpirituall gluttony in him; Thoſe are things which are not to be accepted of, or deſired, for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per feeling or particular delight, but only as means helping vs to arriue vnto thoſe ends which we haue mentioned. Like as one who is ſicke and can indure no meat that is good for him, is glad when he come to find ſome taſt and reliſh in it, not becauſe it is pleaſant to his pallat, but becauſe it prouokes his appetite to eate,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2439:135"/>and conſerues his life, ſo alſo a ſeruant of God is not to ſeeke ſpirituall conſolation, as to inſiſt vpon it, but becauſe with the heauenly refreſhment therof, his ſoule is ſtrenghtned and encouraged to ſuſtaine the paine and labour of the way of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to go on with conſtancy. And in this manner, comforts are not deſired for comforts ſake, but only for the greater glory of God, and ſo farre forth as they redound vnto his honour and glory.</p>
               <p>But I ſay yet more, that one may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire theſe ſpirituall conſolations in ſuch manner, &amp; for thoſe ends which we haue ſaid which are good and holy, and yet for all this there may be exceſſe in it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and ſelfe loue may haue ſhuffled in it ſelfe among thoſe deſires; as when we deſire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too importunatly, with too great ſolicitude, and greedines, ſo as to be leſſe content if we obteine them not, and leſſe pliable to the will of God; but to remaine troubled, grudging, and in a painfull diſquietnes. This is no other then a diſordinate affection, and ſpirituall couetouſneſſe; for we are not ſo to depend on theſe ſenſible feelings; and to ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirituall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolations with ſo great aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2439:135"/>as to hinder our peace and quietnes of mind, and make vs leſſe conformable with the will of God, if he ſhould pleaſe not to beſtow them on vs: ſeing the will of God alone, is better and more worth then all theſe things together, and it is more expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vs, to content our ſelues therewith.</p>
               <p>And that which I ſay of theſe feelings and ſpirituall conſolations, is to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewiſe to the gift of prayer, and the feruour and facility which we deſire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as alſo of the internall peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our mind, together with all other fauours, graces, and ſpirituall prerogatiues; ſeing that we may be tranſported with an affection too diſordinate, in the deſire of euery one of theſe, as when we couet them with ſuch impatience and anxiety, as (if we obteine them not) to become troubled, malecontent, and leſſe confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the will of God. Alſo by theſe feelings and ſpirituall conſolations, we vnderſtand here not only deuotion, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible feelings, and ſpirituall ſweetneſſes, but alſo the ſubſtance it ſelfe and gift of prayer, and the facility of applying our ſelues vnto it, and perſeuering at in it, with
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2439:136"/>that tranquility and repoſe as we deſire, yea it is this of which for the preſent we principally do treat, indeauouring to declare how we are to conforme our ſelues vnto the will of God therin, and not to ſeeke it with to great anxiety and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtnes; for concerning conſolations, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings &amp; ſenſible deuotions, there are none who would not endure the want of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo they might haue the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of prayer, and obteine the fruite therof: for they know that prayer conſiſts not in theſe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, denotions, and in tendernes of mind, and therfore without any great vertue they may be had, but for one to go to prayer, and remaine there as if he were a ſtone with ſo great aridity and drineſſe, as if to pray were the leaſt of his buſineſſe for which he came, it ſeeming to him that God hath wholly withdrawne himſelfe from him, barring him from all acceſſe vnto him, &amp; that that curſe is falne vpon his head, which God long ſince did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to his people.

               <p>This is a point of greateſt conſequence it being on of the commoneſt complaints, and wherwith they are moſt contriſtated, who giue themſelues to the exerciſe of prayer, for they ſigh and weep when they find themſelues in this manner, whilſt on the one ſide they heare ſo much ſaid in the praiſe of prayer, and of the good ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and how according as that paſſes, ſo the daies and liues of ſpirituall men do paſſe, whilſt they likewiſe vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that it is one of the principalſt meanes as we haue, as well for our owne particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as that of our neighbour; and on the other ſide ſee themſelues ſo farre (in their opinion) from making any good prayer: this, this grieueth, this afflicts them much, this maks the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke that God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; thinks no more vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this maks the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare they haue wholly loſt his fauour, and are falne into his diſpleaſure and diſgrace, ſeing it ſeemes to them, that he cuts them of from all refuge, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

And therfore euery one is entirely to conforme himſelfe vnto the will of God, in this barrenneſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2439:144"/>in imitation of our Sauiour Chriſt ſpiritually abandoned hanging vpon the croſſe; accepting of this ſpirituall morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for terme of his whole life, if God ſhall pleaſe for to diſpoſe it ſo, with a pure intention, only to content Almighty God therwith. This is an acte of great patience and loue of God, and a moſt high and profitable prayer; yea and ſuch an on, as there doe not want thoſe who eſteem them for glorious Martyrs,

               <p>LIke as we conforme our ſelues vnto the will of God, in what manner ſo euer he ſhall diſpoſe of vs in prayer, ſo alſo are we to do, in all other vertues &amp; gifts of God, and in all ſpirituall fauours and prerogatiues, it is good to haue all vertues in deſire, to aſpire vnto them, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to attaine them; but we are in ſuch manner to deſire to become better, and to go forwards and increaſe in vertue, as not to be diſquieted if we obteine not that which we deſire, and to conforme our ſelues vnto the will of God, and place our whole contentment and delight therin. If God be not pleaſed to beſtow vpon you an Angelicall purity, but would haue you ſuffer in that kind violent tentations, it is farre better for you to haue patience in it, and to accommodate your ſelfe vnto the will of God, in this tentation and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2439:156"/>then to diſquiet and trouble your ſelfe, with bootleſly lamenting of your caſe that you cannot attaine vnto that purity and candour of the bleſſed ſoules, in heauen, if God be not pleaſed to beſtow vpon you ſo profound a humility as <hi>S. Francis</hi> had, neither a mildnes, anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of <hi>Moyſes</hi> or of <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor in fine ſo great a patience as that of holy <hi>Iob,</hi> but letteth you experience the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motions &amp; appetits, your beſt courſe were to humble your ſelfe and to embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the ſhame, which may giue you occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of hauing your ſelfe in a more vile eſteeme; which will not be effected if you remaine troubled with it, and ſpend your ſelfe in ſilly complaints and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, becauſe God hath not indowed you, with an equall patience vnto holy <hi>Iob,</hi> or ſuch a humility as <hi>S.

<note place="margin">Auila c. 23. Audi filia.</note> I do not belieue (ſaith he) that there hath euer been Saint in the world, who deſired not to become better then he was, but that notwithſtanding did not hinder quiet of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2439:157"/>mind ſince they deſired it, not out of any cupidity of their owne (for that is inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; neuer cryeth enough) but only for God, with whoſe diſtribution they ſhould haue been content, although he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them leſſer then they had, eſteeming it the part of on who loueth loially and truly indeed, to content himſelfe with that which is giuen him, rather then to deſire more, how euer ſelfe loue may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it is to be able to ſerue Almighty God the better.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, that our ſpeech ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to tend to this, that we ſhould not be very forwards and feruent in deſiring to be more perfect and vertuous then we are, but that we ought to remit ourſelues wholly vnto God as well in matter of ſoule, as of our body, and from thence they may imagine that we may giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſome, of becoming more tepide and negligent, and neuer to ſtriue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfect, or make progreſſe in vertue. This point is well to be heeded, ſeing it is not of little importance; this obiection and reply, is ſo forcible that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in this treatiſe to be feared. There is no doctrine, how ſound or good
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2439:157"/>ſo euer it be, which may not be abuſed by thoſe who know not how to apply it as they ought, &amp; of this number are as well thoſe things which appertaine to prayer, as thoſe which concerne all other vertues, and ſpirituall gifts, and therfore it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that this be well declared and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. I do not ſay that we are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire euery day to be better &amp; holyer then other, and to be alwaies imitating thoſe who are more perfect, with the greateſt diligence and feruour as we can, for we are come into Religion, only vnto this end, and if we do not this we are no good Religious men: but that which I ſay is, that we are to carry our ſelues in this point, as we do in exteriour things, where a man muſt be diligent to procure them, but not anxious, nor too couetous, as the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay, and our Sauiour prohibiteth it in the Euangell; <hi>Dico vobis ne ſoliciti ſit is animae veſtrae, quid manducetis,
<note place="margin">Math. 6.25.</note> nec corpori veſtro quod induamini,</hi> where that which he reprehends is a care and anxiety too inordinate, and an appetit of thoſe things too immoderate: but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth not a moderat care, and requiſit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but rather comaunds it, and hath

Then ſaid our B.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2439:164"/>but rather that he ſhould the more ſecure it, ſeing that out of confidence in God, he had choſen for his greater ſeruice, to remaine here expoſed ſtill to daungers; For what King, or Prince is there in the world, ſaid he, who after he had offered his ſeruant ſome extraordinary recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his ſeruice, and the ſeruant had reſpited the acceptance of it, the better to do ſome important thing for him, who would not hold himſelfe in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner obliged, not only to reſerue it for him, but to giue it him afterwards with addition, ſeing that he had depriued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the preſent poſſeſſion of it only out of loue to him, and his affection to do him greater ſeruice.

               <p>And we may extend this exerciſe vnto the glory of the immaculate virgin and all the other Saints, and it would be a good and laudable deuotion, vpon their particular feaſts, to ſpend ſome part of our prayer in this exerciſe, ſeing it is the moſt eſpeciall ſeruice and honour which we can exhibit to them, as declaring the greateſt loue that we can beare them, which is, to wiſh them all the good which they can poſſibly haue, and reioyce and congratulat their great &amp; excellent glory.

And ſo the deuout ſoule by conſidering in prayer, how moſt worthy God Almighty is, to be loued, honoured and ſerued of his creatures, is to wiſh and earneſtly deſire that all the ſoules which are, or euer ſhall be, may know him, loue him, praiſe him, and glorify him in euery thing (and out of the depth of its deare affection ſay) ô Lord who ſhall conuert all the Infidells and ſinners of the world, ſo as there may not be left any to offend you more, but that all may be obedient to you, and employ themſelues wholly vnto your ſeruice, both now, and for euer more:
